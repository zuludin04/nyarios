# Nyarios
Nyarios is Real-Time chatting application using Flutter and Firebase as backend. 
The name 'Nyarios' was coming from Sundanese language wich means 'speaking', since it is a chatting app so I believe it is make sense.
I've been building this application from 2-3 months ago as my personal project.
As the suggest this application heavily inspired by Whatsapp so there are so many features that similar to Whatsapp.
